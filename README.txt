Weather-Analysis with E-Scooter usage.
Analyzing the correlation between weather conditions and general e-scooter usage with correlating revenue.

The Analysis is divided into two segments:

descriptive analysis
predictive analysis

before analyzing, the raw data was extracted from the German weather homepage and the e-scooter data were provided by my professor from machine learning class in university.
The raw data was "dirty" data, which means it was incomplete, un un-homogenous. 

First Task was to clean the data and check for abnormalities, like single data spikes or unusual statistical data. 

Descriptive analysis uses data visualization for first look into overall performance of E-scooters in different weather conditions. simple correlation Matrix and interactive data visualization were used. 
W.L.O.G. weather data/conditions are correlated to each other

Predictive analysis uses machine learning algorithm to predict future revenue on weather conditions.
